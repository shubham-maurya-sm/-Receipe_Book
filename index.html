                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>Making the Dough<br>1.  In a mixing bowl, combine all-purpose flour, salt, and carom seeds.
                            Add ghee or oil and rub it into the flour until it resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add water and knead into a firm and smooth dough. Cover with a damp cloth and set aside to rest for 20-30 minutes. <br>2. Preparing the Filling : Heat oil in a pan and add cumin seeds. Let them splutter. Add grated ginger and chopped green chilies, sautéing for a few seconds.Add boiled and mashed potatoes, green peas, turmeric powder, coriander powder, garam masala, red chili powder, amchur, and salt. Mix well and cook for a few minutes until the spices are well combined. Add chopped coriander leaves, mix, and let the filling cool. <br>3. Assembling the Samosas Divide the dough into equal-sized balls and roll each one into a thin oval shape. Cut the oval in half to form two semi-circles. Take one semi-circle and fold it into a cone, sealing the edges with a little water. Fill the cone with the potato mixture and seal the top edge tightly, making sure there are no gaps. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling.<br> 4. Frying the Samosas:  Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat. Fry the samosas in batches on medium-low heat until they turn golden brown and crispy. Avoid frying on high heat to ensure the pastry cooks evenly.  Drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.   </p>

                        <p class="meal-descript-about">In cuisine, an omelette is a dish made from beaten eggs, fried with butter or oil in a frying pan. It is quite common for the omelette to be folded around fillings such as chives, vegetables, mushrooms, meat, cheese, onions or some combination of the above.

                        <p><br>1.  3 eggs, beaten <br>2. 1 tsp sunflower oil<br>3. 1 tsp butter</p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>1. Beat the eggs: Use two or three eggs per omelette, depending on how hungry you are. Beat the eggs lightly with a fork. <br>2. Melt the butter: Use an 8-inch nonstick skillet for a 2-egg omelette, a 9-inch skillet for 3 eggs. Melt the butter over medium-low heat, and keep the temperature low and slow when cooking the eggs so the bottom doesn’t get too brown or overcooked. <br>3. Add the eggs: Let the eggs sit for a minute, then use a heatproof silicone spatula to gently lift the cooked eggs from the edges of the pan. Tilt the pan to allow the uncooked eggs to flow to the edge of the pan <br>4. Fill the omelette: Add the filling—but don’t overstuff the omelette—when the eggs begin to set. Cook for a few more seconds <br>5. Fold and serve: Fold the omelette in half. Slide it onto a plate with the help of a silicone spatula.

                        <p class="meal-descript-about">Idli is a traditional South Indian breakfast dish that is soft, fluffy, and steamed. It is made from a fermented batter of rice and urad dal (black gram lentils). Idlis are known for their light, airy texture and are considered healthy, as they are low in fat and easily digestible. Idli is often served with accompaniments like coconut chutney, sambar, or a variety of chutneys and spicy powders.

                        <p><br> <br>1. Idli rice - 2 cups (short-grain rice specifically used for making idlis)<br>2.Urad dal (split and dehusked black gram) - 1 cup <br>3.Fenugreek seeds (methi seeds) - ½ teaspoon (optional, for aiding fermentation) <br>4.Salt - to taste   <br>5.Water - as needed for soaking and grinding </p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>1. Soaking the Ingredients<br>Soak the Rice: Rinse the idli rice a few times until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in enough water for at least 4 to 6 hours. Soak the Urad Dal: Rinse the urad dal a few times and soak it in enough water along with the fenugreek seeds for at least 4 to 6 hours. <br> 2. Grinding the Batter Grind the Urad Dal: Drain the soaked urad dal and fenugreek seeds. Grind them in a wet grinder or a high-speed blender until you get a smooth and fluffy batter. Add water gradually as needed to achieve a light and airy consistency. <br> Grind the Rice: Drain the soaked rice and grind it to a slightly coarse batter (a little grainy in texture) using a little water. The rice batter should not be too smooth.  <br>Mix the Batters: Combine the ground urad dal and rice batter in a large mixing bowl. Add salt and mix well, preferably with your hands, to help with the fermentation process.<br> 3. Fermenting the BatterFermentation: Cover the bowl with a lid and let the batter ferment in a warm place for 8 to 12 hours or overnight. The batter should rise and become airy and slightly tangy. The duration of fermentation depends on the room temperature; it may take longer in colder climates.<br>4. Steaming the Idlis  Prepare the Idli Molds: Grease the idli molds or plates lightly with oil to prevent sticking. Pour the Batter: Gently stir the fermented batter and pour it into the greased idli molds, filling each mold about ¾ full.<br>Steam the Idlis: Place the idli molds in a steamer or pressure cooker without the whistle. Steam on medium heat for 10 to 12 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into an idli comes out clean.
                            <br>Remove and Cool: Once done, remove the idli stand from the steamer and let it cool for a few minutes. Use a spoon or knife to carefully remove the idlis from the molds.

                        <p class="meal-descript-about">Biryani is a popular and aromatic South Asian dish made with rice, a blend of spices, and usually some form of protein like chicken, lamb, beef, fish, or vegetables. The dish is known for its rich flavor, fragrant aroma, and beautiful layering of rice and meat or vegetables. Here's an overview of biryani rice, its ingredients, and the preparation steps:</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class = "meal-instruct">
                        <h3>Ingridients:</h3>
                        <p><br>For the rice:  <br> 2 cups basmati rice  <br> 4 cups water  <br> 1 bay leaf   <br>4-5 cloves   <br>2-3 green cardamom pods  <br>1 cinnamon stick <br> Salt to taste  <br>For the biryani masala: <br> 2 large onions, thinly sliced  <br>1 cup yogurt  <br>1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste  <br>1 teaspoon turmeric powder  <br>2 teaspoons red chili powder  <br>2 teaspoons coriander powder <br>1 teaspoon cumin powder <br>1 teaspoon garam masala<br>Salt to taste<br>2 tablespoons cooking oil or ghee (clarified butter) <br>A pinch of saffron soaked in 2 tablespoons of warm milk (optional) <br>Fresh coriander and mint leaves, chopped </p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>1. Marinate the Protein (if using):
                            In a bowl, mix the protein with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour for better flavor.<br>2.Cook the Rice:Wash the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. This removes excess starch and prevents the rice from clumping.Boil 4 cups of water in a pot. Add bay leaf, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon stick, and salt.
                            Add the rice to the boiling water and cook until it is 70-80% cooked. Drain and set aside.<br>3. Prepare the Biryani Masala: Heat oil or ghee in a large, deep pan or pot. Add the sliced onions and sauté until golden brown. Remove half of the fried onions for garnishing later.Add the marinated protein to the pot and cook on medium heat until the meat is tender and oil begins to separate from the masala. Add coriander powder, cumin powder, garam masala, and salt. Cook for an additional 5-7 minutes. <br>4.Layering the Biryani:Spread half of the cooked rice evenly over the protein and masala mixture. Sprinkle half of the chopped coriander and mint leaves over it. Add the remaining rice on top and garnish with the reserved fried onions, more coriander and mint leaves, and the saffron milk (if using).<br>5.Final Steaming (Dum Cooking):Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid or seal with aluminum foil to trap the steam. Cook on low heat for 20-25 minutes to allow theflavors to blend and the rice to absorb the aromas. This process is known as "dum cooking." <br>6.Serve: Gently fluff the biryani with a fork before serving to avoid breaking the rice grains. Serve hot with raita (yogurt dip), boiled eggs or salad. <br><br>Tips for Best Results: Use good quality basmati rice for long and fluffy grains. Marinate the protein overnight if possible, to enhance the depth of flavors. Layer carefully to keep the rice grains intact and separate. </p>

                        <h3>Ingridients:</h3>
                        <p><br> 1. For the Batter:  <br>1 cup all-purpose flour (maida)  <br>2 tablespoons cornstarch  <br>1/2 cup plain yogurt  <br>1/4 teaspoon baking soda (optional)  <br>Water as needed to make a thick batter  <br>A pinch of yellow or orange food coloring (optional) <br>2. For the Sugar Syrup: <br>1 cup sugar <br>1/2 cup water<br> 1/4 teaspoon saffron strands or 1/2 teaspoon cardamom powder <br>1/2 teaspoon lemon juice <br>3. For Frying: <br>Ghee or oil </p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>Prepare the Batter: In a mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, cornstarch, and yogurt. Add water gradually to make a smooth, thick batter. Add the food coloring if desired. Cover the batter and let it ferment for 4-6 hours or overnight for a better flavor.<br>2. Make the Sugar Syrup: In a pan, add the sugar and water. Bring it to a boil while stirring to dissolve the sugar. Once it reaches a one-string consistency (slightly thick but not caramelized), add the saffron or cardamom powder and the lemon juice to prevent crystallization. Keep the syrup warm on low heat. <br>3.Fry the Jalebis: Heat ghee or oil in a deep pan over medium heat. Pour the batter into a squeeze bottle or piping bag with a small round tip. Squeeze the batter into the hot oil in circular motions to form spiral shapes. Fry until golden and crispy on both sides. <br>4.Soak in Sugar Syrup: Remove the fried jalebis from the oil and immediately dip them into the warm sugar syrup for 1-2 minutes. Ensure they are coated well, then transfer them to a plate.<br>4.Serve: Serve hot or at room temperature, often accompanied by rabri (thickened sweetened milk) for an extra indulgent treat.
